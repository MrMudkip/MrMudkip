# Backstory
My name is Leon Peter Keates. I was born on the 19th of December, 2005 in Gosport, Hampshire, UK. I am currently on my college holidays, until September, when I start my 
second year/semester. This will be where I start a Level 1 course in Digital Business Industries, and I will do this in Somerset. I am not allowed to tell you where exactly,
as I have to protect my privacy. I am also Autistic, and I have an upcoming assessment for ADHD, as well as a confirmed diagonsis for PTSD, which were reasons I cannot tell either.
I lived in Gosport from 2005 to 2010, which I moved to Somerset in around June/July, and then I moved to Bridgwater from 2013 to 2022. I then moved back to Taunton in 2022, and I currently
reside there. This is where I start my future in Technology, Programming; you get the idea!
